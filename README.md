# Term-Project-1

Welcome to the Data Engineering 1 Term Project repository. This repository hosts essential files and resources related to the project.

## Files and Resources

- **SQL File with Code:**
  - Explore the SQL code file containing the project's database schema and queries: [SQL File with Code](https://github.com/Alejandra-savagebriz/Term-Project-1/blob/main/TP1_SQL_Code.sql)


- **Dump Folder with SQL Dump Files:**
  - Access the dump folder for additional SQL dump files: [Dump Folder with SQL Dump Files](https://github.com/Alejandra-savagebriz/Term-Project-1/tree/main/Dumps)


- **EER Diagram:**
  - Review the Entity-Relationship Diagram (EER) for a visual representation of the database structure: [EER Diagram](https://github.com/Alejandra-savagebriz/Term-Project-1/blob/main/EER_Diagram.mwb)


- **Report Document:**
  - Read the project report document to gain insights into the methodology, findings, and conclusions: [Report Document](https://github.com/Alejandra-savagebriz/Term-Project-1/blob/main/Report.md)


- **Python Notebook for Visualizations:**
  - Explore the Python notebook for visualizations created during the project: [Python Notebook for Visualizations](https://github.com/Alejandra-savagebriz/Term-Project-1/blob/main/TP1_Visualizations.ipynb)


- **Dataset Folder:**
  - Find datasets used in the project within the dataset folder: [Dataset Folder](https://github.com/Alejandra-savagebriz/Term-Project-1/tree/main/Datasets)


## Note

By accessing the primary SQL file, you can review the entire project setup and data manipulation. The tables have manually inserted values so it is not mandatory to open the dump files; these provide redundancy for the events, triggers, views, and store procedures created.
It is not necessary to download the datasets to execute the Python Jupyter Notebook since the code extracts the files directly from the Datasets folder in this repository.
